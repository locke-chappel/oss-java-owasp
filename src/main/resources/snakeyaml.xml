        Snakeyaml's security stance is don't parse untrusted data in unsafe ways: 
        https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/issues/561/cve-2022-1471-vulnerability-in
        
        This CVE appears to be targeted at a specific constructor that should not be used with
        untrusted data.
        
        In most use cases (e.g. Spring, Micronaut, etc.) the input is considered safe as it
        typically is the application's configuration files and not use provided input.
